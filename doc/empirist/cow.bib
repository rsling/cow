  Abstract                 = {Eigennamenerkennung ist ein wichtiger Bestandteil der maschinellen Aufbereitung von Texten. Sowohl für die theoretische Linguistik als auch für weiterführende automatische Sprachverarbeitungsschritte stellt sie eine wesentliche Voraussetzung dar. Besonders für die morphologisch komplexe Sprache Deutsch ist dies eine Herausforderung, nicht zuletzt, da es sich um eine der wenigen Sprachen handelt, in der zusätzlich zu Eigennamen (EN) auch alle anderen Substantive groß geschrieben werden. Somit fällt die Kapitalisierung von Wörtern als grundlegender Hinweis für das Vorliegen eines EN weg. Dies führt zu einer wesentlich schlechteren Performanz von EN-Erkennern auf deutschen Texten im Vergleich zu englischen beispielsweise. Dieser Performanzunterschied lässt sich bereits für meist stark editiertes Zeitungsmaterial beobachten. Unter dem Aspekt der wachsenden Bedeutung von Internetdaten als Grundlage für linguistische Forschung ist es nun besonders relevant zu überprüfen, wie verlässlich EN-Erkenner auf den meist sehr heterogenen Web-Korpora funktionieren, in denen auch eher spontansprachliches Material, wie beispielsweise Forentexte, enthalten ist. In Rahmen dieser Arbeit habe ich daher drei frei zugängliche state-of-the-art Software-Tools auf einem aus dem webgecrawlten DECOW2012-Korpus abgeleiteten, manuell erstellten Goldstandard evaluiert, die speziell für die EN-Erkennung in deutschen Texten entworfen wurden. Der für den Goldstandard genutzte Teil des DECOW2012 wurde zuvor nach Genres klassifiziert, sodass genaue Aussagen über den Performanzunterschied der Tools auf stärker editierten und weniger editierten Textsorten möglich ist. Zusätzlich wird eine detaillierte statistische Fehleranalyse durchgeführt, woraus abschließend Möglichkeiten zur Verbesserung der Performanz von automatischen EN-Erkennungsprogrammen abgeleitet werden. },
