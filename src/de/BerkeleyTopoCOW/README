This is a minor adaptation of Slav Petrov's Berkeley parser as provided by Cheung and Penn
at https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/topoparsing/ for topological parsing of German.

Most modifications concern convenient handling of input and output formats, for use 
in the COW web corpus project (http://corporafromtheweb.org/):


* With the -useGoldPOS option, reads vertical text, with TAB-separated
  annotations. First column: token; second column: gold POS tag;
  all other columns will be ignored. Sentences must be separated by
  a blank line, and the input text must end with a newline char.

* The maximal sentence length can be passed as a command line argument
  (defaults to 200 tokens). 

* Sentences longer than maxLength, or otherwise not parseable, will 
  be copied to output (NOT omitted).

* Substitutes parentheses with square brackets in the input.
 
* Performs some mapping from standard STTS-tags (or token-pos pairs) 
  to a version known to the parser.

* With option -outputXML, outputs and XML-like format with topological field
  labels and phrase structure labels as XML-elements.

* Improved diagnostic and error messages.

* The -kbest and -nThreads options have been omitted.
