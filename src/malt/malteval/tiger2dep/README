This is the tiger2dep conversion script,
which converts the TiGer corpus into dependency format.
It now also converts the German part of the SMULTRON corpus 
(http://www.cl.uzh.ch/research/parallelcorpora/paralleltreebanks/smultron_en.html)
and the 707 sentences of EuroParl manually annotated by Sebastian PadÃ³
(http://www.nlpado.de/~sebastian/data/projection/german_goldgold.xml.gz)

The script contains two parts, one that applies a number of corrections to the source files,
and one that converts the corrected version to dependencies. The dependency conversion is also capable of 
introducing empty heads for verb ellipses in the data (only tested for TiGer so far).

REQUIREMENTS:
the script relies on BeautifulSoup 4 (included in archive) for reading the tigerxml,
which in turn needs the lxml-Parser installed (http://lxml.de/)


USAGE:
for producing a corrected version of the treebank (prerequisite for the conversion)
$ python apply-corrections.py latin1 tiger_release_aug07.xml corrections/* > tiger_release_aug07.corrected.xml

for producing the conversion:
$ python tigerxml2conll09.py -i tiger_release_aug07.corrected.xml -m corrections/manual_heads.pl > tiger_release_aug07.corrected.conll09

type -h with the conversion script to get help on configuration options

There are bash scripts (convert-tiger.sh, convert-smultron.sh, convert-europarl.sh) that you can run to convert the source files. 
Usage is documented inside the scripts.

The conversion of TiGer needs quite a lot of memory because the whole corpus is represented as a DOM
object for the error correction. I would run it on a server with a couple of GB available.
Once this is done, the actual conversion to dependencies does not need much memory.
